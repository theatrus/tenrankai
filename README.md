A high-performance web-based photo gallery server written in Rust using the Axum web framework. Tenrankai provides a responsive gallery interface with automatic image resizing, metadata extraction, and intelligent caching.

It's a gallery, CMS, and blog platform relying on nothing more than folders and files. Simply drop files in, or even use SyncThing to keep your gallery or website up to date.

The name "Tenrankai" (展覧会) is Japanese for "exhibition" or "gallery show", reflecting the project's purpose as a platform for displaying photographic collections.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.89.0 or later (automatically managed by rust-toolchain.toml)
- DejaVuSans.ttf font file (required for watermarking)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tenrankai.git
cd tenrankai

# Default build with AVIF support
cargo build --release

# Build without AVIF for easier compilation (especially on Windows)
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

The project includes a `rust-toolchain.toml` file that will automatically download and use Rust 1.89.0 when you run cargo commands. This ensures consistent builds across all development environments.

### Build Options

**AVIF Feature Flag**: Tenrankai includes optional AVIF support that can be disabled for easier builds on platforms where AVIF dependencies are difficult to compile.

- **With AVIF (Default)**: Full HDR AVIF support including gain maps, ICC profiles, and advanced color management
- **Without AVIF**: AVIF files are ignored, resulting in smaller binaries and simpler dependency requirements

**Platform Recommendations**:
- **Linux/macOS**: Use default build with AVIF support
- **Windows**: Consider using `--no-default-features` if you encounter build issues with AVIF dependencies

## Configuration

### Running the Server

```bash
# Using default config.toml with AVIF support
cargo run --release

# Run without AVIF support (faster builds, especially on Windows)
cargo run --release --no-default-features

# With custom configuration
cargo run --release -- --config /path/to/config.toml

# Specify host and port
cargo run --release -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Enable debug logging
cargo run --release -- --log-level debug
```

### Command Line Options

- `--config <path>`: Path to configuration file (default: config.toml)

- `--port <number>`: Override configured port
- `--log-level <level>`: Set logging level (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
- `--quit-after <seconds>`: Auto-shutdown after specified seconds (useful for testing)

### Utility Commands

#### AVIF Debug Command

Analyze AVIF files to inspect their HDR properties, color spaces, and gain maps:

**Note**: This command is only available when building with AVIF support (default build).

```bash
# Basic analysis
cargo run -- avif-debug path/to/image.avif

# Detailed technical information
cargo run -- avif-debug path/to/image.avif --verbose
```

This command displays:
- Image dimensions and file size
- Color space properties (primaries, transfer characteristics, matrix coefficients)
- HDR detection results
- Gain map presence and parameters
- CLLI (Content Light Level Information) data
- ICC profile information
- Detailed HDR detection logic (with --verbose)

## Gallery Features

### Multiple Galleries

Tenrankai supports multiple independent gallery instances, each with its own:
- Source directory for photos
- URL prefix for web access
- Cache directory and settings
- Templates (customizable per gallery)
- Image quality and pagination settings

Example URLs for different galleries:
- Main gallery: `http://localhost:8080/gallery/`
- Portfolio: `http://localhost:8080/portfolio/`
- Archive: `http://localhost:8080/photos/archive/`

### Gallery Organization

#### Directory Structure

```
photos/
├── vacation-2024/
│   ├── _folder.md          # Folder description (markdown)
│   ├── IMG_001.jpg
│   ├── IMG_001.md          # Image caption (markdown)
│   └── IMG_002.jpg
└── landscapes/
    ├── _folder.md
    └── sunset.jpg
```

### Markdown Support

- `_folder.md`: Place in any directory to add a description that appears at the top of the gallery page
- `<imagename>.md`: Create alongside any image to add a caption (e.g., `sunset.jpg` → `sunset.md`)

#### Advanced Folder Configuration

Folders can use TOML front matter in `_folder.md` files for advanced configuration:

```markdown
+++
hidden = true
title = "Private Collection"
require_auth = true
allowed_users = ["alice", "bob"]
+++

# Optional Markdown Content

This folder is hidden from gallery listings but remains accessible via direct URL.
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `hidden = true`: Hides the folder from gallery listings, previews, and counts (but allows direct access)
- `title = "Custom Name"`: Override the folder display name
- `require_auth = true`: Require user authentication to access this folder
- `allowed_users = ["user1", "user2"]`: Restrict access to specific users (implies require_auth)

**Hidden Folders:**
- Do not appear in gallery navigation or listings
- Are excluded from gallery preview images and image counts
- Remain fully accessible if you know the direct URL
- Perfect for private collections or work-in-progress galleries

**Access Control:**
- Access restrictions are hierarchical (parent folder restrictions apply to children)
- Users must be authenticated to access folders with `require_auth = true`
- Only listed users can access folders with `allowed_users` specified
- Access control applies to folder browsing, image viewing, and API endpoints

## Posts System

Tenrankai includes a flexible posts/blog system that supports multiple independent collections:

### Post Format

Posts are markdown files with TOML front matter:

```markdown
+++
title = "My Post Title"
summary = "A brief summary of the post"
date = "2024-08-24"
+++

# Post Content

Your markdown content here...
```

### Multiple Post Systems

Configure multiple independent post systems in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[[posts]]
name = "blog"
source_directory = "posts/blog"
url_prefix = "/blog"
posts_per_page = 20
refresh_interval_minutes = 30  # Auto-refresh posts every 30 minutes

[[posts]]
name = "stories"
source_directory = "posts/stories"
url_prefix = "/stories"
posts_per_page = 10
```

Each system has its own:
- Source directory for markdown files
- URL prefix for web access
- Templates (customizable)
- Posts per page setting
- Optional automatic refresh interval for detecting new/changed posts

### Features

- Full CommonMark support with extensions (tables, strikethrough, footnotes)
- Automatic HTML generation from markdown
- Chronological sorting (newest first)
- Pagination support
- Subdirectory organization (URL reflects directory structure)
- Dynamic refresh via API
- Automatic periodic refresh (configurable interval)
- Individual post reloading when files change
- Dark theme optimized code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Responsive post layout for mobile and desktop

## Image Sizes

Tenrankai automatically generates multiple sizes for each image:

- **Thumbnail**: Small preview images for gallery grid
- **Gallery**: Standard viewing size used in the gallery layout
- **Medium**: Larger size with optional copyright watermark
- **Large**: Full quality (requires authentication)

All sizes support @2x variants for high-DPI displays.

### Color Profile and HDR Support

Tenrankai preserves ICC color profiles and HDR metadata throughout the image processing pipeline:

- **JPEG**: Extracts and preserves ICC profiles from source images
- **PNG**: Extracts ICC profiles from iCCP chunks and preserves transparency
- **WebP**: Embeds ICC profiles using libwebp-sys WebPMux API
- **AVIF** (when built with AVIF feature): Full HDR support with advanced features:
  - Preserves ICC profiles and HDR metadata (color primaries, transfer characteristics, CLLI)
  - Supports gain maps for HDR/SDR tone mapping
  - Automatically detects and preserves HDR content (BT.2020, Display P3, PQ/HLG)
  - 10-bit encoding for HDR images
  - Gain map preservation during image resizing
- **Wide Gamut**: Full support for Display P3, Adobe RGB, BT.2020, and other color spaces
- **Watermarking**: Color profiles and HDR metadata maintained even when adding copyright notices

This ensures accurate color reproduction across all devices and browsers that support color management. PNG images are always served as PNG to preserve transparency and avoid quality loss.

## Authentication

Tenrankai supports both email-based and WebAuthn/Passkey authentication for secure access:

1. **User Management**: Users are managed via a TOML file (`users.toml`)
   - Copy `users.toml.example` to `users.toml`
   - Add users with their username and email address
   - No self-registration - admin manages all users
   - When `user_database` is not configured, the system runs without authentication

2. **Login Flow**:
   - User visits `/_login` and enters their username or email address
   - System sends an email with a secure login link
   - User clicks the link to authenticate
   - Session is maintained via secure HTTPOnly cookies
   - Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP)

3. **User Administration**:
   ```bash
   # List all users
   cargo run -- user list
   
   # Add a new user
   cargo run -- user add --username alice --email alice@example.com
   
   # Remove a user
   cargo run -- user remove --username alice
   
   # Update user email
   cargo run -- user update --username alice --email newemail@example.com
   ```

### WebAuthn/Passkey Authentication

Tenrankai supports modern WebAuthn/Passkey authentication for passwordless login:

**Prerequisites for WebAuthn**:
- Configure `base_url` in your `config.toml` (required for WebAuthn to work)
- HTTPS connection (required by WebAuthn specification, except for localhost)

**Features**:
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint, face recognition, or hardware security keys
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Passkeys sync across devices via platform providers (iCloud, Google, etc.)
- **Fallback Support**: Email-based login remains available when WebAuthn is unavailable
- **Multiple Passkeys**: Users can register multiple passkeys per account

**Passkey Management**:
- After email login, users are prompted to enroll a passkey for faster future logins
- Users can view their profile and manage passkeys at `/_login/profile`
- Profile page shows username, email, and registered passkeys
- Passkeys can be removed through the profile interface
- New passkeys can be enrolled from the profile page

**Login Flow with WebAuthn**:
1. User visits `/_login` and enters their username
2. If passkeys are available, user can choose passkey authentication or email fallback
3. For passkey login: Browser prompts for biometric/hardware authentication
4. For email login: Traditional email link is sent
5. After successful email login, user is offered passkey enrollment

**Email Configuration**: Configure an email provider in your `config.toml`:
- **Production**: Use `provider = "ses"` with Amazon SES for reliable email delivery
- **Development/Testing**: Use `provider = "null"` to log emails to console instead of sending them
- **No Configuration**: Without email configuration, login URLs will be logged to the server console

### Running Without Authentication

To run Tenrankai without user authentication:
1. Remove or comment out the `user_database` line in your config.toml
2. The system will allow access to all features without login
3. The user menu will not appear in the interface

This is useful for:
- Personal use on a private network
- Development and testing
- Public galleries where authentication isn't needed

## Performance

Tenrankai includes several performance optimizations:

- Persistent metadata caching reduces file system access
- Background cache refresh keeps data fresh without blocking requests
- Concurrent image processing with rate limiting
- Automatic cache pre-generation option for instant loading
- Browser-based caching headers for processed images

## Template Structure

Templates are organized into three directories:

```
templates/
├── pages/              # Regular page templates
│   ├── index.html.liquid
│   ├── about.html.liquid
│   ├── contact.html.liquid
│   └── 404.html.liquid
├── modules/            # Module-specific templates
│   ├── gallery.html.liquid
│   ├── image_detail.html.liquid
│   ├── posts_index.html.liquid
│   └── post_detail.html.liquid
└── partials/           # Reusable template components
    ├── _header.html.liquid
    ├── _footer.html.liquid
    └── _gallery_preview.html.liquid
```

All templates use the Liquid templating language and support includes for reusable components.

## Static Files

Tenrankai supports cascading static directories, allowing you to overlay custom files over default ones:

### Configuration

```toml
[static_files]
# Single directory (backward compatible)
directories = "static"

# OR multiple directories with precedence
directories = ["static-custom", "static-default"]
```

### File Precedence

When multiple directories are configured:
- Files in earlier directories take precedence over files in later directories
- If `logo.png` exists in both `static-custom` and `static-default`, the one from `static-custom` is served
- Files unique to any directory are accessible normally
- Useful for:
  - Custom themes that override default assets
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Gradual migrations between asset sets

### Required Files

Place the following in one of your static directories:

- `DejaVuSans.ttf` - Required for copyright watermarking
- `favicon.svg` - Used to generate favicon.ico and PNG variants (optional)
- `robots.txt` - Custom robots file (optional, defaults provided)
- Any other static assets referenced in templates

The system will search all configured directories in order to find these files.

## Logging

Control logging verbosity with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable or `--log-level` flag:

```bash
# Examples
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
cargo run -- --log-level trace
```

## Development

Tenrankai is under active development with a comprehensive codebase and documentation.
